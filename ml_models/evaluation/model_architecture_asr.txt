# ASR Model Architecture

```
Audio Input → Mel-Spectrogram → CNN Layers → Bi-LSTM Layers → Fully Connected → CTC Loss
                              (3× Conv1D)    (2× Bi-LSTM)     Layer          Output
                              
Details:
1. Audio Preprocessing:
   - Sample Rate Conversion: 16kHz mono
   - Mel-Spectrogram Extraction:
     * Window size: 25ms (400 samples)
     * Stride: 10ms (160 samples)
     * Mel filters: 80

2. CNN Feature Extraction (3 Layers):
   - Conv1D Layer: Extracts local features
   - Batch Normalization: Normalizes activations
   - ReLU Activation: Introduces non-linearity
   - Dropout (0.1): Regularization

3. Bi-LSTM Sequence Modeling (2 Layers):
   - Hidden Units: 256 units per layer
   - Bidirectional: Forward & backward processing
   - Dropout: 0.1 between layers

4. Output Layer:
   - Fully Connected: 512 → 40 classes
   - Softmax: Probability distribution
   - Character Set: 39 chars + 1 blank token
